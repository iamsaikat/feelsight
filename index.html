        <h1>Privacy Policy for FeelSight</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how FeelSight ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a transparent approach to data handling.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We want to be clear: <strong>FeelSight does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from its users.</strong> We do not ask for your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other data that could identify you. Our focus is on providing a functional tool without compromising your personal privacy.</p>
        <p>The App operates primarily by processing data locally on your device.</p>

        <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
        <h3>Android Camera Permission (`android.permission.CAMERA`)</h3>
        <p>Our application requires access to your device's camera. This permission is fundamental for the core functionality of the FeelSight app. The camera is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Facial Expression Analysis:</strong> The app utilizes the camera to capture real-time video streams of your face. This video stream is processed *locally on your device* to detect and analyze your facial expressions and associated mood.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-time Feedback:</strong> The analysis of your facial expressions provides real-time feedback within the app, helping you to understand and track your emotional states.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> We want to assure you that no images or video data from your camera are ever stored, transmitted, or shared with us or any third party. All camera processing for facial expression analysis occurs entirely on your device, and the data is immediately discarded after processing. Your privacy is paramount, and this permission is used solely to enable the app's intended functionality.</p>

        <h3>Other Permissions</h3>
        <p>Based on the `AndroidManifest.xml`, the app also requests the following permissions for specific functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>`android.permission.INTERNET`: Used for general internet access, potentially for updates or external resources not related to personal data.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: These may be used for storing app-related data locally or managing app resources. No personal data is stored using these permissions.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: Allows the app to start certain services (e.g., notifications) after the device reboots.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.VIBRATE`: Used for haptic feedback, typically for notifications or user interactions.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.WAKE_LOCK`: Prevents the device from sleeping when certain tasks (e.g., background processing for notifications) are active.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: Allows the app to send notifications to the user (Android 13+).</li>
            <li>`android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`: Used for scheduling precise alarms, often in conjunction with notifications.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT`: Allows the app to use full-screen intents, typically for high-priority notifications.</li>
            <li>`android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: Allows the app to run services in the foreground, essential for continuous operations like background notifications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of these permissions are used to collect or transmit your personal data.</p>

        <h2>3. Log Data</h2>
        <p>In the event of an error or crash within the App, we may collect data and information (through third-party products) called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This information is used solely for debugging and improving the app's stability and performance, and it is anonymized where possible.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the app integrates with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Awesome Notifications:</strong> Used for managing and delivering local notifications within the app. While this service handles notification delivery, it does not access or transmit your personal data.</li>
            <!-- Add other third-party services if applicable -->
        </ul>
        <p>These third parties have access to your (non-personal) Log Data only to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us with your (non-personal) information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
